# zXd12's Advent Of Code 2023

My solutions for the advent of code 2023.
Also one of the first time I use Rust, so it won't be idiomatic past covered by the compiler.

| day 1 |            |            | Very easy start, the 2nd question is probably a lot of fun to optimize with finite-state machines.                                       |
| day 2 |            | ⭐          | Peoples seems to say its easy, but the parsing is much more complex to optimize than day 1. Assumptions were made about the game IDs.    |
| day 3 | ⭐          |            | Still no real algorithmic challenge. We'll have to use 2d grid parsing a lot this month, so hopefully parsing will take less of my time. |
